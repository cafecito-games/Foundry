# Callable.is_async() reports whether the target method is a coroutine, both for
# methods declared `async` and for methods whose body is inferred to be a coroutine.
# Async lambdas and async @rpc method references report as async too. Bind/unbind
# delegation is covered by the C++ test in tests/core/variant/test_callable.h.
# Extends Node so the @rpc annotation is valid (RPC requires a Node).
