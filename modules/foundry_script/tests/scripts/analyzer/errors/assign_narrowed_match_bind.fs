# A match/case payload bind is read-only, and a type test narrowing it must not weaken that: typing
# the bind's own identifier node against the narrowing (needed for a compound op's implicit read; see
# `FSAnalyzer::reduce_assignment()`) must still mark it constant, or this assignment goes unreported.
