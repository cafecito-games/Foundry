# A type parameter as the source of an assignment is decided by a runtime type test rather than
# statically, but only as far as its bound reaches: no value of `Self` bound to a class is ever an
# `int`. `self` is typed `Self` in every body of a class, so the destination is refused where it is
# written instead of compiling and failing the runtime check, in every position a value travels to. An
# ordinary bounded type parameter answers the same way.
