# The `Self` contract decides a callable argument by structural identity, so a tail the parameter
# declares is part of what the argument must supply: a tail whose element type is unrelated is
# rejected, and so is one narrower than `Self`, since the receiver may resolve to a sibling leaf that
# is not that subclass. A fixed-arity callable is rejected where the parameter declares a tail it will
# invoke. A tail the parameter never invokes is admitted instead, but that argument still carries
# `Self` in its own fixed prefix, so it answers to receiver identity and reaches only the calling
# frame's own receiver.
