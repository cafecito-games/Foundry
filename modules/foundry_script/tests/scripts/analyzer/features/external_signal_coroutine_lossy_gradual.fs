# A coroutine signal parameter whose result type is a script class cannot round-trip through
# PropertyInfo: the lossy result is dropped, so a directly accessed external signal carrying it crosses
# gradually (via the MethodInfo fallback) instead of becoming a false strict mismatch against the same
# annotated type. Direct signal-member access goes through the serialized boundary, unlike a method
# return, so this exercises the result-less coroutine decode end-to-end.
