# A foreign class (`RtcWidget`, from a companion file) is retroactively conformed to the `RtcPrintable`
# trait, supplying the required `describe()` witness externally. The witness body resolves against the
# target: `label` is `RtcWidget`'s own member. Once conformed, an `RtcWidget` value is assignable to a
# trait-typed slot, satisfies `is`/`as` against the trait, satisfies a generic bound `T: RtcPrintable`,
# and is accepted by a trait-typed parameter. Compiled but not run: runtime witness dispatch is Phase 3.
