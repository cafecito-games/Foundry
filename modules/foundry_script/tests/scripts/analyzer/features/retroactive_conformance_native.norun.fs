# A native engine class (`RefCounted`) is retroactively conformed to the `RtcNativeCounter` trait,
# supplying the required `live_count()` witness externally. The witness body resolves against the
# native target's surface: `get_reference_count()` is `RefCounted`'s own engine method, proving witness
# bodies type-check against the ClassDB surface (not an FS member layout). Once conformed, a native
# value is assignable to a trait-typed slot, satisfies `is`/`as` against the trait, satisfies a generic
# bound `T: RtcNativeCounter`, and is accepted by a trait-typed parameter. Compiled but not run.
