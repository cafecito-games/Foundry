# A cross-script trait witness is matched through the compiled `MethodInfo`/`PropertyInfo` boundary,
# which transports a scalar integer parameter's carrier only, not its declared width (see the width-
# erasure boundary documented at `FSAnalyzer::type_from_property()`). The base script's `amount: int`
# parameter decodes wide but carrier-erased at the witness-matching site, and the witness comparison
# treats a carrier-erased width as an unconstrained wildcard rather than a genuine mismatch, so this
# matching declared `int` on both sides is accepted.
