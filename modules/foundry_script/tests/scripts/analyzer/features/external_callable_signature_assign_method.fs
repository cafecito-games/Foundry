# A decoded explicit Callable from another script keeps a MethodInfo mirror, so a matching
# MethodInfo-only callable (the native method reference set_process, which is (bool) -> void) stays
# assignable to a variable inferred from the external Callable[[bool], void] return. Without the mirror
# the decoded side would carry an empty MethodInfo and wrongly reject the assignment on argument count.
