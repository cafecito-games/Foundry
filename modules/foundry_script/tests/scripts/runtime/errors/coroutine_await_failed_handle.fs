# Regression for #1944 (error path): a suspended coroutine that fails with a runtime error after
# resume latches the default value of its declared return type. A later `await` of its handle
# resolves immediately with that default (empty String here) instead of parking forever. The runtime
# error itself is reported at failure time exactly as before; no new error object is introduced.
