# An instance async method that builds a `Self`-typed container after `await` must resolve `Self`
# against the receiver's leaf on the resumed frame, not just on the initial frame. The typed local is
# declared and built after the await so its descriptor is resolved on the resume path: before the
# fix that path left `FrameSelfBinding` with no receiver for an instance frame, so the array built
# after the await read back as the declaring class rather than the receiver's leaf. The whole chain
# runs synchronously through one signal emission (the harness calls `test()` once with no main loop).
