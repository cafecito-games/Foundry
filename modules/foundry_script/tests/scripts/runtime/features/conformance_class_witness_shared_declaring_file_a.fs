# Class-target counterpart of the shared-declaring-file regression for issue #1965. This fixture and
# `conformance_class_witness_shared_declaring_file_b` deliberately share one declaring file
# (`csw_shared_class_doubler_ext.notest.fs`) so the fix is pinned for non-builtin conformance targets,
# not just builtins. This fixture calls the witness on a directly typed local.
