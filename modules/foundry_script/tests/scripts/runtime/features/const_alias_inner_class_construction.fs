# A `const` aliasing an inner class (no generic specialization) can be instantiated through the
# alias with `.new()`, exactly like the inner class name itself. The alias must resolve to the live
# compiled subclass rather than the analyzer's shallow, uncompiled folded class object. The same
# holds across compilation units: an alias of an *external* (preloaded) inner class also constructs,
# resolving to the live external subclass held by GDScriptCache.
