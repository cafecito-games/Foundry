# A static call that suspends resumes with the receiver it began on, checked by what it builds after
# the suspension rather than by its declared return type. The awaited nested call suspends too, so the
# outer frame's receiver has to survive a suspension that happened inside another frame.
#
# `test()` cannot await anything itself -- the harness calls it once with no main loop -- so each job
# is started, handed to a fire-and-forget drainer that parks on it, and then released by one signal
# emission that resumes the whole chain synchronously.
