# Structured-concurrency fan-out over genuinely suspending jobs. Every job hits an internal `await`
# on a shared signal mid-body, so all three are started and parked concurrently before any of them
# resumes. Each is awaited from its own fire-and-forget runner (`await _job(value)`), which connects
# to the job's still-live FSFunctionState while it is suspended. A single `go.emit()` then
# releases every job in start order, and each completion resumes its runner to collect the String
# result. This exercises the live function-state handoff for a fan-out, which the eager-completion
# coroutine_fan_out fixture deliberately avoids.
#
# (A genuinely suspended handle cannot be stored in an `Array[Coroutine[String]]` in a debug build:
# capturing the result of an async call without awaiting it raises a runtime error. Each handle is
# therefore awaited in place by a runner rather than collected into a typed array, and results are
# gathered in the shared `_results` array in deterministic start order.)
