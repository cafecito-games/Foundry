# Epic capstone: "start now, hold the handle, await later" end to end. A genuinely *suspending* async
# job is started and its live `Coroutine[String]` handle is captured into a named variable (`handle`)
# instead of being awaited in place. The job parks on `await go` before producing any result, so the
# capture yields the in-flight `FSFunctionState`; holding it no longer trips the debug "async
# function without await" guard. Unlike the side-effect fixtures, the result here is consumed by an
# actual `await handle` rather than observed through a member write.
#
# `test()` cannot await the handle itself: the harness calls `test()` once with no main loop, so a
# park inside `test()` could never resume. The held handle is therefore handed to a fire-and-forget
# runner started *before* the resume signal fires, so its `await handle` connects while the job is
# still suspended. A single `go.emit()` then resumes the job synchronously, whose completion resumes
# the runner and yields the awaited String. This gives a deterministic order with no frame/timer
# pumping while exercising the held-by-name (PR #621) plus awaited-later (PR #616) flow together.
