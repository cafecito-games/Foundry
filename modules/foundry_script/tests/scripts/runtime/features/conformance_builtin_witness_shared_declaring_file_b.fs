# Regression for issue #1965: this fixture and
# `conformance_builtin_witness_shared_declaring_file_a` deliberately share one declaring file
# (`csw_shared_int_doubler_ext.notest.fs`) instead of each getting a private copy. Whichever of the
# two fixtures runs first in the process compiles the declaring file and registers its runtime
# witness; the other must get a cached-script hit and still be able to dispatch that witness. This
# fixture calls the witness on an `int` function parameter rather than a local.
