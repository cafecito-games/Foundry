# Regression for #1944: `await` on a `Coroutine[T]` handle whose coroutine already finished parked the
# awaiter forever on a one-shot `completed` signal that had fired exactly once. After the fix, the
# second (and every later) `await` of a resolved handle resolves immediately with the latched result.
#
# The job genuinely suspends on `await go`, so calling it yields an in-flight `Coroutine[String]`. A
# fire-and-forget drain runner is started before the resume signal fires, so its first `await` connects
# while the job is still suspended. A single `go.emit()` resumes the job synchronously; the job
# completes and latches its result, which resumes the drain's first await, then the drain's second
# await finds the handle already resolved and yields the same latched value without parking.
