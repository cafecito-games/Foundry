# Companion foreign target class for the instance-witness direct-call runtime fixture. It declares no
# trait of its own; the fixture supplies the conformance with an `extend`. Its `power` member is read
# by the instance witness, proving the witness runs against this class's layout with the instance as
# `self`.
