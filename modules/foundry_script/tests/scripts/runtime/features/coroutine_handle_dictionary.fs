# Genuinely suspending async jobs whose live handles are held as the values of a typed
# `Dictionary[String, Coroutine[String]]`. Each job parks on `await go` before recording anything,
# so storing the call result in the dictionary captures the in-flight `GDScriptFunctionState`
# instead of a finished value. Holding the handles this way is intentional, not a missing-await bug,
# so it no longer trips the debug "async function without await" guard. The jobs are resumed in one
# shot and results observed through a member side effect, because the test harness calls `test()`
# once with no main loop to resume an awaited handle.
