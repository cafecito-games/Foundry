# A `static func` whose signature references `Self`, called through an instance receiver rather than
# the class handle, resolves `Self` against the receiver. The instance names a class exactly as a
# class handle does, so the call dispatches just as `Child.take(...)` would instead of failing for
# want of a receiver.
#
# `Self` binds to the receiver's runtime class, matching how an instance method reached through the
# same receiver resolves it. Analysis substitutes the receiver's *static* type, which is always a
# base of that runtime class, so the static promise stays an upper bound of what the frame sees.
