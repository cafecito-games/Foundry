# An async static lambda retains the captured receiver across suspend/resume. The lambda is created in
# a static frame, escapes it, and only then is started; it suspends on a signal and constructs `Self`
# after the resume. The receiver it sees on resume is the one it was created with, never the resuming
# caller's context. `test()` runs once with no main loop, so a single signal emission resumes the
# whole chain synchronously (same drain pattern as type_self_coroutine_resumption_receiver).
