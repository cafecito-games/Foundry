# A native engine class (`RefCounted`) is retroactively conformed to `RtcNativeGreeter` in a SEPARATE
# file that this fixture `preload`s, rather than inline. This proves a native retroactive conformance
# declared cross-file is visible to the using code: the witness dispatches through the trait type (via
# a trait-typed local and a trait-typed parameter), and `is`/`as` against the externally-conformed
# trait both work on the native value.
